# Bubble Sort



Bubble sort is the simplest sorting method.  This sorting algorithm requires multiple passes to execute.  After each pass, the next largest item is in the correct position (bubbles up).  It can be costly regarding time complexity. In the best case scenario, where an array is already sorted, we'll need a single pass. O(1) In the worst case scenario, an array may be sorted in reverse order, we will need *n* passes O(*n*). Regarding comparisons, in both scenarios we *n-1* comparison need to take place.  O(*n*)

In summary, Bubble Sort runs in O(n<sup>2</sup>)
